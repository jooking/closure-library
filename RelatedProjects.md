# Introduction #

Closure Library is the core library used for many Google Projects, and is intended have other code written on top of it in separate namespaces.  Other users of Closure Library have open sourced code they've written, and we link examples we know of here.

We only link to these examples on an as-is basis and cannot vouch for the quality or stability of the code, but would like to encourage Closure-Library-style coding outside Closure Library.

# Contribute #

Please contact [closure-library-discuss](https://groups.google.com/group/closure-library-discuss) if you'd like to share your code.

Please follow Closure Library style and use a unique namespace (not `goog.*`) so that others might use your code without conflict.
