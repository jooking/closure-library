# Introduction #

Closure Library is the JavaScript library behind many of Google's heavy-duty web applications.  It's a wide but modularized library, using a namespacing and dependency system separate out classes and utilities, allowing web developers to pull "only what you need".

The Closure Library modules include:

  * reusable UI widgets and controls
  * utilities for DOM manipulation
  * classes for server communication
  * animation utilities
  * data structure implementations
  * a unit testing system
  * rich-text editing
  * a whole lot more

## Cool! Where do I start? ##

To start, see the [Closure Library Documentation](http://code.google.com/closure/library/docs/overview.html), check the FrequentlyAskedQuestions, and look through the ClosureLibraryResources.

You should also [browse the source](http://code.google.com/p/closure-library/source/browse/) -- each file, class, method, and function is documented.

Also, check out the rest of the [Closure Tools](http://code.google.com/closure): [Closure Compiler](http://code.google.com/closure/compiler/), [Closure Templates](http://code.google.com/closure/templates/), and [Closure Inspector](http://code.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/inspector.html).
