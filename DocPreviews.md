# Introduction #

This page links to preview versions of documents that will eventually be published at <a href='http://code.google.com/closure/library/'><a href='http://code.google.com/closure/library/'>http://code.google.com/closure/library/</a></a>. The preview versions published here are rough drafts. They may contain incorrect or outdated information, so use at your own risk.

When these docs are published at http://code.google.com/closure/library/ , they will be deleted from this wiki and replaced with a link to the polished version. Wiki edits to the preview versions may be incorporated into the polished version, or they may be lost. Edit at your own risk.

We welcome feedback on this stuff! Use the comments field or closure-library-discuss@googlegroups.com to give feedback.
