# Closure Library #

## Closure Library's source repository has [moved to GitHub](https://github.com/google/closure-library). ##

The Closure Library is a broad, well-tested, modular, and cross-browser JavaScript library. You can pull just what you need from a large set of reusable UI widgets and controls, and from lower-level utilities for DOM manipulation, server communication, animation, data structures, unit testing, rich-text editing, and more.


The Closure Library is server-agnostic, and is intended for use with the [Closure Compiler](http://developers.google.com/closure/compiler).  At Google, it's used in
[Web Search](http://google.com),
[Maps](http://maps.google.com),
